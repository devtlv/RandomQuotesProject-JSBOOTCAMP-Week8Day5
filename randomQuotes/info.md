#Build a Random Quote Generator with React

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devtlv/studentsGitHub/master/JS/Week%208/Day%205/Mini%20Projects/randomQuotes/quotes%20image.png)

You can check out a demo [here](http://di-random-quotes.surge.sh/){:target="_blank"}

- You will use as the database for the quotes [this file](https://github.com/devtlv/studentsGitHub/blob/master/JS/Week%208/Day%205/Mini%20Projects/randomQuotes/QuotesDatabase.js){:target="_blank"} containing an array of objects
- You will display in a box a random Quote as a header, downstairs the autor of the quote, and a button that when you click calls a function that generates a new quote from the database and replaces the current one, and also it will change randomly the color of the background, the color of the header quote and the color of the button.


Good luck!
